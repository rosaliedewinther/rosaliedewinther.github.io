For the first time, I could work on a ray tracer with the help of a very good and dedicated lecturer, namely Jacco Bikker. During the course, we first implemented a Whitted style ray tracer (on the CPU). I was pleasantly surprised with the performance, as I thought nothing could be rendered (let alone ray traced) on the CPU.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/voxels/ class="link black dim">Voxels</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As quite some people do, I got inspired by John Lin&rsquo;s voxel engine and thus, got started researching how voxels work. At first, I started with a meshing based approach similar to minecraft and got some basic lighting going. One of the first real issues I encountered was with transparency, as I did not have much experience with graphics I did not realize it would be such a hassle to render transparent water for example.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/principal-component-analysis-of-league-of-legends-champions/ class="link black dim">Principal component analysis of League of Legends Champions</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">League of Legends is a popular 5 vs 5 game where matches last between 20 and 40 minutes (usually) and you can choose to play any out of 150+ champions, each differing in play style, strengths and weaknesses. Most players have a certain play style or champion which they prefer, while some just play whatever they feel like playing. Since I regularly play League with my friends and was stuck deciding which champion I should play next, I did a principal component analysis based on data scraped from a popular League statistics website named lolalytics.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/drone-follow/ class="link black dim">Drone follow @HU</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For this assignment, we were meant to use PID systems in some form to control movement in the real world. So me, being stuck in my room during a corona lock down, had no hardware in my house besides a Tello drone. Due to this, I was basically forced to implement a PID controller for each of the 4 degrees of freedom of the drone. This allowed for quite fine-grained control of the drone, even in small spaces, such as my room.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/rts-game/ class="link black dim">Real time strategy game @HU</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">During the 2nd year of my bachelor, me and five others made a real time strategy (RTS) game. The assignment was to make a game (without the use of a full game engine), and as we all enjoyed Age of Empires, we decided to make an RTS. We thought this would be an interesting challenge as it required an enemy who would autonomously control their units. Furthermore, it required additional path finding AI for all units.</div></div></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://jasperdewinther.github.io/>&copy; Jasper de Winther 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
