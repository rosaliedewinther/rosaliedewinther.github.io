For the first time, I could work on a ray tracer with the help of a very good and dedicated lecturer, namely <a href=https://twitter.com/j_bikker>Jacco Bikker</a>. During the course, we first implemented a Whitted style ray tracer (on the CPU). I was pleasantly surprised with the performance, as I thought nothing could be rendered (let alone ray traced) on the CPU. In the scene below you see most of the implemented effects, reflection, refraction, directional lights, point lights, beer&rsquo;s law, vignetting, anti aliasing, gamma correction and chromatic aberration.</p><p><img src=/images/advanced_graphics_whitted_ray_tracer.png alt=whitted></p><p>For the second assignment of the course, I added a Bounding Volume Hierarchy to allow for complex models to be traced. These BVH&rsquo;s used the surface area heuristic and instancing to allow for many copies to be traced. Below are a visualization of a BVH and a scene containing a total of, 1087474000 triangles (which was rendered in 11 seconds).</p><p><img src=/images/advanced_graphics_bvh.png alt=bvh>

Unfortunately I did not have time to optimize it all too well, and there are some artifacts which should have been resolved (the bounce direction is not correctly distributed, which can be seen clearly in the bottom image). Below are two images rendered using this version of the path tracer.</p><p><img src=/images/advanced_graphics_sheep.png alt=bvh>

It also inspired me to continue looking into ray tracing.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://jasperdewinther.github.io>&copy; Jasper de Winther 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
