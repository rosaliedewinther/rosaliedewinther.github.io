We thought this would be an interesting challenge as it required an enemy who would autonomously control their units. Furthermore, it required additional path finding AI for all units. Some gameplay can be seen below. Resources are being collected, units being trained, buildings being built and enemies being defeated, with some speedups in between.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UaVAjuyEBRU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>The game was written in C++ and used <a href=https://www.sfml-dev.org/>SFML</a> for the rendering. Unfortunately, we had no artists in the team, so we used freely available sprite sheets. The biggest issue with our implementation was performance (as it often is in games). Notably, the performance of A* and rendering was not great. However, these issues were later fixed by using culling and general optimizations. In the end, we got a very smooth game with quite a lot of bugs, but at least it is fun to play (in my opinion).</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://jasperdewinther.github.io>&copy; Jasper de Winther 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
