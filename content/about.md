I'm currently a software engineer at [Traverse Research in Breda](https://traverse.nl/), with a focus on graphics. Before this I did a Master's degree in Game and Media Technology at Utrecht University, a minor in Data Science at Technical University Eindhoven, a bachelor in Computer Engineering at HU University of Applied Sciences. Besides this I have done internships at [VicarVision](https://www.vicarvision.nl/) and [Sentient Information systems](https://www.sentient.nl/). 

In my spare time I enjoy skating, programming, calisthenics, cooking and playing/analyzing games.
