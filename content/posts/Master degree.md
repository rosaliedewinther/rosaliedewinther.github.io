To finish the Game and Media Technology master's program I obviously had to write and defend a thesis. I was very lucky to be able to do this in collaboration with [Traverse Research](https://traverse.nl/), and work on some awesome tech. During this time I ventured into the wonderful world of volumetric rendering, with [Emilio Laiso](https://x.com/emiliolaiso). I worked on the data structure, which ended up being largely inspired by [VDB](https://www.openvdb.org/). And Emilio did the shading. Of course with plentiful collaboration when we could help each other out. During this time I also got to present my work which was an amazing opportunity.
